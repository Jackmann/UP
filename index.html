        <h2>Our Goal</h2>      
        <p>The main idea of Data Room is that with more information we can make better decisions about how we spend our money. And, we can use this data to help you sell more, and hopefully, make more money.

        If you can use math and absolutes to predict certain outcomes, it eliminates some of the flawed decision-making we're all prone to.

        So, how can you get started? First, you start by asking a simple question: what are you trying to figure out? For example, you may want to know how customers move through your sales funnel. Do they call first? Do they visit your website, then call? Where do customers originate from online?

        </p>
        <p>Second, you need to determine if you are able to collect data on these questions? Is anyone tracking leads through the sales funnel? If so, what type of data are they collecting? If not, you've identified an opportunity to begin collecting big data that can eventually answer these questions for you.

        Big data starts with a question — it doesn't start with the data.</p>
